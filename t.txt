Coherence provides mechanisms to integrate with other services using TopLink, Java Persistence API, Oracle Golden Gate[5] and other platforms using APIs provided by Coherence.

Coherence can be used to manage HTTP sessions via Coherence*Web,[6] in which application services such as Oracle WebLogic Server, IBM WebSphere, Apache Tomcat and others are claimed to get the same performance, fault tolerance, and scalability as data.

In the summer of 2020, Coherence Community Edition was released as open source on GitHub.[7] Some Coherence usage patterns are also open source and are listed and supported through the Oracle Coherence incubator.[8] These patterns implement features such as messaging, work distribution and data replication across wide area networks with Coherence.
